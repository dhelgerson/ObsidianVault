# Probability vs statistics
ex for determining population:
take a sample. mark sample. release. take another sample. then 
$P=\dfrac{tagged}{\%marked}$

sample mean $\not=$ population mean

$\bar x$ = sample mean
$\mu$ = population mean
## Plot Box
$Ex:$ -> 25, 28, 37, 30, 34, 35, 29, 29, 35, 38
1. order them: 25, 28, 29, 29, 30, 34, 35, 35, 37, 38
2. find the median -> $\dfrac{30+34}{2}=32$
3. find the quartiles
	- 1st quartile is median of data pts left of median -> 25, 28, **29**, 29, 30
	- 3rd quartile is media of data pts to right of median -> 3,4 35, **35**, 37, 38
4. complete '5 no. summary' by finding min/max
	Min: 25
	Max: 38
	5 no. summary: 25, 29, 32, 35, 38
