# Boolean Algebra
## Boolean Multiplication:
| statement | outcome |
| --------- | ------- |
| 0 x 0     | 0       |
|           |         |
## addition - kinda logical or
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 1
## compliment
reverses elements value
$\bar 0 = 1$
$\bar 1 = 0$

$1*1+1*\bar z$ where $z=1$
$1+1*\bar z$
$1+1*\bar1$
$1+0$
$1$
## laws of boolean algebra
(exactly like boolean logic laws. just w/ the signs switched 'cause boolean algebra)
## functional completeness
a set of operations is functionally complete if any boolean function can be expressed using only operations from the set.

boolean algebra is used to describe electric gates
