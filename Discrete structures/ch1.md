### Propositions:
- a statement that can be evaluated to true false
	- ex:

| proposition | is prop |
| - | - |
| zero is an even number | y |
| it is raining | y |
| is it raining? | n |
| do your homework | n |
|24 divided by 12 is 6 | y |
| did you do your homework? | n |
### Truth Values:
- one plus one is 2
## Propositional variables:
- variables that can be used to denote arbitrary propositions
	- such as i or j when counting loops
	**Ex:**	
 - p is true and q is false
- **compound propositions**: evaluating propositional variables together
- #### Compound propositions:
	- **Conjunction:** or 'and'
		- denoted by `^`
	- **Disjunction:** or 'or'
		- denoted by `v`
	- **Exclusive Or**:
		- denoted by a circle w/ a plus
	- **Negation**: or 'not'
		- denoted by a little carrot

## order of operations:
## `PNCD`
- parenthesis, not, conjunction disconjunction

### conditional operation
- denoted by an arrow
- read as `if _ then _`

| p | q | p -> q |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| t | t | t |
| f | t | f |
| t | f | t |
| f | f | t |

- it's weird

| base | p -> q |
| ---- | ---- |
| converse | q -> p |
| contrapositive | !q -> !p |
| Inverse | !p -> !q |
### Biconditional:
- read `if and only if`

| p | q | p <-> q |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | F |
| F | F | T |
## Tautology & Contradiction
- tautology - a proposition that only results in true values
- contradiction - proposition that d results in false values

| p | !p | p v !p | p ^ !p |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| T | F | T | F |
| F | T | T | F |
## Logical equivalency:
- propositions that have the same truth value regardless of the truth values of their individual propositions.
- denoted as a triple equal sign
### Propositional Logic Proof:
- see slides on canvas for equivalency laws
