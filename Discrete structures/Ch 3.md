# Sets
## Set Notation:
**Roster Notation**: $A=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ 
Belongs (in) to: $5\in A$ 
Very large sets: $A= \{1,2,3,...,99\}\equiv$ all integers between 0 and 100
sets are **equal** if they have the same elements in them
### Predefined Sets:
| symbol | name | ex |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| $\mathbb{N}$ | natural numbers | $\{1,2,3,...\}$ |
| $\mathbb{Z}$ | integers | $\{...,-1,0,1,...\}$ |
| $\mathbb{R}$ | all real numbers | can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b \not=0$  |
| $\mathbb{U}$ | universal set | everything in the domain for a given context |
### Set Builder Notation:
$C= \{x\in \mathbb{Z}:0<x<100\}$
	c is made up by all integers between 0 and 100
### Subsets:
$\emptyset \subseteq A\subseteq B$ 
	every element of a is in b
