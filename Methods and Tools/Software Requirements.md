# software life-cycle
- set of activities that take place between the time the software programs conceived and the time is finally retired
- many engineers break the development process down into the following phases
	- requirement
	- design
	- implementation
	- testing
	- deployment/maintenance
- typically these all happen discretely
## requirements:
- decides what the project is supposed to accomplish
- the only output of this phase is documentation
### Types:
- functional requirements
	- services system provides
	- how it reacts
- non-functional requirements
	- constraints
	- features
- domain requirements
	- runtime environment
	- etc
