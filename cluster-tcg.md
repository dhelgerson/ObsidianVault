### Types: Compute
- CPU systems - standard/fighter
- GPU systems - Tanks/heavyweight
- TPU systems - specialized/flanker'ish
- Storage Systems - support 
### Energy: Cluster Resources
- Power 
- Cooling
- Networking
### Trainers: Support Staff/Students
staff prevent issues, students buff performance. Staff remain throughout play, Trainers are required for cluster operations. each trainer has a perk that will aid in a specific operational circumstance (detailed later)
- Vince (staff) - "There is no further escalation"
	- make things happen "now"
- Oliver (student) - Code optimization: jobs require 1 less turn to complete
### Weaknesses
- GPU - Massively parallel, weak for single-threaded
- CPU - All-rounder (Basic type)
- TPU - Not much support, Extremely good at it's battles
### Commander Cards: Facilities
each deck will have 1 commander. it gives perks and weaknesses. it also determines the amount of resources available based on the turn.
- HPC$^2$ - less resources, but the tight-knit support staff offers some advantages
- New Datacenter - LOTS of space and power
- ORNL - many resources, things take longer to stand up due to red tape, etc.
### Trap Cards:
all 
### Turn Flow:
- Clusters take multiple Turns to "Stand Up"
- Players compete to complete different "jobs" before other players, playing to cluster strengs and weaknesses
- "trap cards" such as downtime, security breach
- players will have their own decks to with which they'll build out their clusters. 
- the game will also have a global deck which players will draw from
- the global deck will have either jobs, or trap cards. 
- each cluster built can be allocated a job, their types and sizes will determine how long jobs take to complete
- mutually exclusive to jobs, clusters can be upgraded. if a cluster working on a job is upgraded, the job is paused.
