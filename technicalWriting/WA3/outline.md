Type the heading for the case you are responsible for
- Piper Alpha
Write out the goal(s) of this section (align with the assignment specifications)
- to outline what went wrong and what ethics were ignored
Write out 2-4 main points you want to make that help you reach your goal(s) for the section
the inoperable pump
For each main point, write 2-3 pieces of evidence you will use to support this point
Note the source(s) for each subpoint/evidence
1. important documents were not taken care of and vital information was not relayed
- the engineer who removed the emergency pressure release valve and placed the blank did not personally ensure that the night shift was aware of such issues. [link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1539-6924.1993.tb01071.x)
2. poor and outdated procedures were caused the inoperability of the automatic fire extinguishing system
- the fire fighting system was put under manual control (which was impossible to enable due to the evacuation of the control room) because of routine diving even though it has already been brought up that it was unnessesarry [link](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.1998.0304) [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20170318145904/http://www.parthenon.uk.com/disaster-piper-alpha-fire.htm)
Arrange the subpoints in a logical way 
Arrange your main points in a logical way
Look back at your goal statement and confirm these points help you achieve that goal. If they don't, revise as needed. 
Write out the code of ethics (e.g., NSPE, ASCE, etc.) you are using and confirm it is mentioned (and cited) throughout your section as you discuss ethical implications of your case
- NSPE Canon 1 a: If engineersâ€™ judgment is overruled under circumstances that endanger life or property, they shall notify their employer or client and such other authority as may be appropriate
Think about how you could introduce your case in the context of ethics and jot down some ideas (this is the introduction to your section)
- twice, workers did not relay vital information to those who needed it. the outdated procedures were still in effect because those who signed off on the safety check noticed the issue and did not mark it as an issue, only a suggestion. also, the engineer who worked on tank A did not inform the night crew about the issue that was present, he only filled out paperwork and left. 
Think about how you could conclude this case in the context of ethics and jot down some ideas (this is the conclusion to your section)
- had canon 1 a not been violated, the incident probably would not have happened. 
Write out your action items for research
Write out your timeline for drafting your section in time for internal team review
Make a plan with your team to determine the best order for presenting the cases in the final paper (i.e., which case is first, second, etc.)
Make a plan with your team to write the introduction and conclusion of the full paper
Make a plan to compile, organize, and review the references section and title page of the full paper
