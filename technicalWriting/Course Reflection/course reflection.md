Imagine you are talking to engineering students who have not taken this course yet, and write a closing reflection that addresses the following questions:

1. What is technical writing or technical communication and how is a course focused on this of 
use in their college education and future careers?

- technical writing teaches you how to write for a technical audience and the importance of this ability. it gives you one of the most used tools in the workplace, to effectively communicate with others in your field. I cannot stress enough how important this class is to a college student recieving a technical degree. in school, especially if you take the class early, it will seem like it's not important, just another easy A. once you get into your chosen field, however, you'll soon realize the importance of technical writing. 

What are professional ethics and how is a course focused on this of use in their college education and future careers?




What did you learn from this course regarding public speaking and presentations?
What advice on the topics above do you have for future students of this course?
You can format this like a letter or like a traditional essay, but be sure to note that you are writing a reflection meant to inform future students, so you should balance your discussion with information about your experience and advice to the future students. Make sure to address all four questions above in your reflection.

The submission should be two pages double spaced and should be uploaded as a Microsoft Word document or PDF.
