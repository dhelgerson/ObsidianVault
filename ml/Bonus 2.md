# Instruction:
## Part 1 
Implement the rule-base-1 for the example in the slides (and the hands out) using Matlab. Plot the three dimensional figures for it.
## Part 2 
Create a Fuzzy Expert System with the following specification:
This is an often used example: The problem the expert system should address is the supplemental feeding of the range cows on the basis of the energy and protein levels of current range forage.

The inputs: Protein and Energy
The output: Feed
### The rules:
	Rule 1: if protein is low and energy is low then feed is high
	Rule 2: if protein is low and energy is medium then feed is medium
	Rule 3: if protein is medium and energy is low then feed is medium
	Rule 4: if protein is high and energy is high then feed is low
Notes:
You are free to choose the range and the membership functions of the inputs and the output. Experiment with different ranges and membership functions to see the effect. Make sure that the Rules viewer shows the correct working according to the above supplied rules.
Plot and submit the 3 dimensional figures for it
