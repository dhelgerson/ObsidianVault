## Covers:
**Genetic Algorithms -> the end of notes**
- Evolutionary strategies
- Genetic programming
	- how they work
	- logic
	- how to tune/optimize
	- how the selection state affects algorithm/perf.
	- steps to build such algorithm
		- from a problem, not just the steps of execution
- Hybrid systems
	- Nero Fuzzy systems
	- Nero Expert Systems
- Hybrid intelligent systems
- Modules 9-12
#### Why is Webex always a problem?
- Cisco is the reason
## Expect:
- graph analysis
- compare / contrast these to systems mentioned earlier
