## Certainty factors:
ranging from -1 <-> 1 maps Definitely not <-> Definitely

| term                 | factor     |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| Defintiely Not       | -1         |
| Almost certainly not | -0.8       |
| probably not         | -0.6       |
| maybe not            | -0.4       |
| Unknown              | -0.2<->0.2 |
| Maybe                |0.4         |
| probably             |0.6         |
| almost certainly     |0.8         |
| definitely           | 1          |
## certainty theory
see slides for equation
function factors the believe of something to be true vs the measure of increased believe due to evidence
