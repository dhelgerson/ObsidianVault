# Abstract
The goal of this project is to develop a neural network-based system for removing background noise from an audio stream. This will be achieved through supervised learning, where the model is trained on recordings that consist of a known sound source mixed with various types of background noise. Each individual training process will be conducted in a known, consistent environment, allowing the network to be more precise and specialized. By providing the neural network with pairs of noisy and clean audio samples, it will learn to differentiate between the two. System evaluation will involve metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement and perceptual audio quality. The end goal of this project is to provide a robust method for removing unwanted artifacts from a microphone during recording and live communication.
