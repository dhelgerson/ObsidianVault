The goal of this project is to develop a neural network-based system for removing background noise from audio streams. This will be achieved through supervised learning, where the model is trained on recordings that consist of a known sound source mixed with various types of background noise. Each individual training process will be conducted in a consistent, known environment, allowing the network to be more precise and specialized. By providing the neural network with pairs of noisy and clean audio samples, it will learn to differentiate between the two. The dataset will cover diverse noise types, but all within the same environment, to ensure reliable performance. System evaluation will involve metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement and perceptual audio quality, aiming to deliver a robust and specialized noise reduction solution for applications in speech processing, hearing aids, and audio recording
