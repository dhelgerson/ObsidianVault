# Evolutionary Computing
- 'just another tool'
## Genetic Algorithm
- can be considered intelligence (Alan Turing's def)
- a set of rules enforced upon a population
- the population improves until the population is better than the prev.
- Population: set of possible answers. usually the best is chosen
- **Neo-Darwinism** is the name for this way of optimization through *mutation*.
- **Evolutionary Fitness** a measure of the organism's ability to anticipate changes in its environment. 
	- "how fit you are compared to the environment" -SR
	- in our algorithm, our fitness function is how we evaluate which units will "reproduce". 
- if you want to find solutions through generations, you need to first provide a representation of the solutions
- each artificial "chromosomes" consist of a number of "genes" which are represented
