## Why
- increase ability to express code ideas
- improve background
- increase learnability
- better understand significance
- better use known languages
# Facts
- first high-level scientific programming language: fortran
- first high-level business programming language: cobol
- first high-level AI programming language: lisp
- first high-level web programming language: html
## Evaluation criteria
- readability
- writability
- reliability
- cost (mostly time)
## Note
von Neumann architecture influences programming languages
# Language categories
## Imperative
## Functional
## Logical
## Markup
# Language implementation: Machine layers
OS and language implementation are layered over machine interface
# Lang impl. mthds
## Compilation
- source is translated to machine code prior to runtime
- generally better performance
## Interpretation
- source is translated line-by-line at runtime
- considered convenient
## Hybrid
- multiple methods of hybrid methods
- combine elements of compilation and interpretation
- often translate to an intermediate
- often partially compiled
# How do we build one?
- process individual words into tokens
- process tokens into syntax using grammar rules
- carry out (interpret) instructions of the code including storing values, doing math, etc
## TIPS
- ten instruction pascal subset
- dev'd in '82 for to teach programming
- simplicity makes it good for a first language
- we'll extend it
