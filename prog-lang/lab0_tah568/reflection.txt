1. Describe one moment during this lab where you had to pause, rethink, or double-check something. What were you trying to do? What made you stop? How did you move forward?
- answering this question. no really. no 2nd thoughs in this lab.

2. Choose one speciﬁc command or line from your script or terminal session that felt non-obvious.  Copy the line exactly as it appears. Explain what role it plays in your workﬂow.
- again, super confident w/ the terminal, nothing here.

3. Include a short excerpt from something your program produced or something you inspected (for example: program output, redirected output, diff, or a permission listing). Paste the excerpt exactly as it appears. Explain what it tells you. Explain what you would check next if it looked wrong.
- I guess we'll go w/ the diff.
```
Hello from abc123 in 4567!				      |	Hello from tah568 in 2026!
This line will not change.					This line will not change.
Your program should not have this line.			      <
```
- diff isn't much to wrap your head around, similar lines appear side-by-side, different lines are separated w/ a pipe, lines not in the other appear on their side w/ a carrot pointing to them. simple stuff.

4. Brieﬂy describe the environment you worked in: OS or environment (Cygwin, WSL, macOS, Linux, etc.)
