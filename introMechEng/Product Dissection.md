NAME:  
Product: PowerXL Air Fryer  
Describe the market parameters of the product- Target Customers, Potential competitors,  
Distinguishing/Key features, Typical cost range  
Air fryers are a lately up and coming product. Air fryers have grown in popularity in the last few  
years. Air fryer targets a whole huge range of customers mostly the food business. Air fryers best  
feature is the fact that it cooks food in a heathier way. Air fryers use a fraction of the oil typical  
deep fryers use. This makes an air fryer heathier and also targets people who care about their  
health. Although the lower end deep fryers are cheaper ($44) than air fryers ($80), people still buy  
the air fryer instead to stay heathier and live longer.  
Describe the function of the product - Are there multiple functions or just one main function for  
the product? What are the primary functions (purposes) for the product? Are there ways in which  
the product could be misused that are dangerous or for which the manufacturer could be held  
liable? What, if any, safety precautions should be considered? Are there engineering codes or  
standards involved in the manufacturing of this product?  
An air fryer has one main function. It is made to produce enough heat and cook whatever is put  
inside it. The product could be harmful due to the fact of it producing temperatures up to 400 F.  
If touched this could harms oneâ€™s physical being. Also, if the air fryer were used to long it could  
overheat and explode. One must be mindful of the air fryer while using it to not touch the metal  
inside of the air fryer, and do not overuse or leave it on for a long time. There are many  
standards and protocols for sanitary food equipment such as the air fryer. One of the rules is  
NSF/ANSI 4: Commercial cooking, prethermalization and powered hot food holding and  
transport equipment.  
What components do you expect to see when you disassemble your product?  
List any necessary/potential design constraints for the product. (minimum/maximum weights,  
size constraints, standards, etc.)  
I think the air fryer will consist of a handful of components. I believe there will be a coil like one  
on an oven, a fan, a type of heat pump, electric wiring and circuits, and some type of thermostat  
to control the temperature.
