# Why study OS?
- crucial for developing stable, secure software
- knowledge of OS aids in troubleshooting and optimizing
- OS concepts are foundational for other areas of computer science
# History of OS dev
- pre-60's had no OS, code was run baremetal
- 60s - multiprogramming and timesharing
- 70s - the UNIX era: pdp11 and paradigm shift to multi-user systems
- 80s - rise of personal computers
- 90s - windows era and birth of linux
- 2000s - rise of mobile embedded systems
- 2010s - cloud computing and virtualization
# User vs Kernel
- OS wants user code to run as a user. it shouldn't have access to the system resources
- Kernel wants to isolate users from each other
- Kernel needs to exclusively run privileged code
# User Mode/Userspace
- limited access to resources
- memory isolation (virtual memory)
- syscalls for resources
