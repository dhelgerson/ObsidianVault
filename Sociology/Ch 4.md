# Socialization
the process in which individuals internalize the values, beliefs, and norms of a given society and learn to function as a member of that society
- Ex: the way young children are taught in school to raise their hand when they want to speak
## Limits of Socialization:
- socialization cannot explain everything about a person's development or personality
- biology is also very important in such
- it is the combination of biology and social interactions that makes someone who they are
## Agents of Socialization:
### Families:
- for most individuals, family is the original source of socialization
- socialization flows both up and down
	- children socialize their immigrant parents
- socialization is affected by various demographics
### School:
- socialization for children entering school shift mainly to teachers and classmates
- schools teach basic behavioral norms; when students resist those norms, many authorities turn to medication
- schools perpetuate social class advantages
	- private prep schools indoctrinate the students who attend them into a world of social status and privilege
### Peers:
- particularly strong agents in adolescence due to the amount of time spent with each other
- peer groups usually expect some sort of conformity from their members: peer pressure
## Theories of Socialization:
### Charles Horton Cooley
- theorized that "self" emerges from our ability to assume the point of view of others and imagine how those others see us
### George Herbert Mead
- developed a theory about how the social self develops over the course of childhood
- infants only know the $I$, but through interaction, they learn about $me$ and $other$
- children develop a concept of the $generalized\ other$, which allows them to apply norms and behaviors learned in specific situations to new situations.
