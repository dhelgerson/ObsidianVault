# Socialization
	the process in which individuals internalize the values, beliefs, and norms of a given society and learn to function as a member of that societ
	Ex: the way young children are taugh in school to raise their hand when they want to speak
## Limits of Socialization:
- socialization cannot explain everything about a person's development or personality
- biology is also very important in such
- it is the combination of biology and social interactions that makes someone who they are
