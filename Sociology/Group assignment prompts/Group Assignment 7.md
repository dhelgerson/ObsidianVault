### What is the role of love in contemporary society
- The same it's always been. love isn't a physical being. it doesn't change roles. love is and always has been exactly what it says. 
the Greek definitions for love are:
- Eros: romantic, passionate love. ...
- Philia: intimate, authentic friendship. ...
- Erotoropia or ludus: playful, flirtatious love. ...
- Storge: unconditional, familial love. ...
- Philautia: compassionate self-love. ...
- Pragma: committed, companionate love. ...
- Ag√°pe: empathetic, universal love. ...
our English word for love means any and all of these, depending on the context.
### What does that mean for the family
- it means everything. a true family should have a good mix of these for it to remain functional. obviously the relationship between romantic partners should have a fair amount of 'Eros', but also a good amount of 'Philia', 'Erotoropia', and 'Storge'.
- similarly, parents should show 'Storge' and 'Pragma' towards their kids
