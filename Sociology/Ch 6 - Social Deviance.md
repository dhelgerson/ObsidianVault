## Functionalist approached to deviance and social control
- **Social Cohesion:** refers to the way people form social bonds, relate to each other, and get along on a day-to-day basis
- Ãˆmile Durkheim theorized that social cohesion's established through one of 2 ways
	- **mechanical** or **segmental** **solidarity**: social cohesion based on the sameness of society parts or members
	- **organic solidarity**: social cohesion based on the different-ness and interdependence of specialized parts or members.
## types of justice
- punitive justice focuses on making violators suffer and thus defines the boundaries of acceptable behavior
- rehabilitative justice examines the specific circumstances of individual transgressors and attempts to find ways to rehabilitate them
## Social control
- the set of mechanisms that create normative compliance in individuals
- normative compliance is the act of abiding by society's norms or simply following the rules of group life
- **formal social sanctions** are rules or laws prohibiting deviant criminal behavior.
- **Informal social sanctions** are unspoken rules and expectations about the behavior of individuals
## Symbolic interactionist theories of deviance
### Labeling Theory
- people see how they are labeled and accept the label as true
- people behave the way they think someone with their label should behave.
## Deviance
- Primary deviance: the first act of deviance that could cause them to be labeled as a deviant
- secondary deviance: acts of rule-breaking that occur after primary deviance and as a result of a person's new, deviant label
## Stigma
- stigma: a negative social label that changes one's behavior toward a person
- there are serious consequences concerning the opportunities that are or are not made available to people who are stigmatized
