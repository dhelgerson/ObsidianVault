# Socialization
the process in which individuals internalize the values, beliefs, and norms of a given society and learn to function as a member of that society
- Ex: the way young children are taught in school to raise their hand when they want to speak
## Limits of Socialization:
- socialization cannot explain everything about a person's development or personality
- biology is also very important in such
- it is the combination of biology and social interactions that makes someone who they are
## Agents of Socialization:
### Families:
- for most individuals, family is the original source of socialization
- socialization flows both up and down
	- children socialize their immigrant parents
- socialization is affected by various demographics
### School:
- socialization for children entering school shift mainly to teachers and classmates
- schools teach basic behavioral norms; when students resist those norms, many authorities turn to medication
- schools perpetuate social class advantages
	- private prep schools indoctrinate the students who attend them into a world of social status and privilege
### Peers:
- particularly strong agents in adolescence due to the amount of time spent with each other
- peer groups usually expect some sort of conformity from their members: peer pressure
## Theories of Socialization:
### Charles Horton Cooley
- theorized that "self" emerges from our ability to assume the point of view of others and imagine how those others see us
### George Herbert Mead
- developed a theory about how the social self develops over the course of childhood
- infants only know the $I$, but through interaction, they learn about $me$ and $other$
- children develop a concept of the $generalized\ other$, which allows them to apply norms and behaviors learned in specific situations to new situations.
- stressed the importance of imitation, play, and games in helping children recognize one another, distinguish between self and other, and grasp the idea that other people can have multiple roles
### Social class and family
- parents of different social classes socialize their children differently
- middle-class parents are more likely to value independence and self-direction in their children, whereas working-class parents prioritize obedience to external authority for their children
- sociologist Annette Lareau conducted an ethnography to study how parents transmit these values to their children
### Annette Lareau
- explains that parenting strategies very by social class, and points out that it is unclear whether these differences affect the long-term outcomes of children
- middle-class parents are more likely to engage in "concerted cultivation"
	- structure children's leisure time w/ formal activities and reason w/ them over decisions in an effort to foster kids' talents
- working class and poor parents are more likely to engage in the "accomplishment of natural growth"
	- give children the room and resources to develop but leave it up to the kids to decide how they want to structure their free time
### Merton & his Role theory
- status is a position in socioty that comes with a set of expectations
- roles are the behaviors expected from a particular status
- role conflict occurs when the roles associated with one status clash with the roles associated with a dfferent status
- role strain occurs when roles associated with a single status clash
### Gender Roles
- sets of behavioral norms assumed to accompany one's status as masculine, feminine, ~~~or other~~
- gender theorists argue that gender roles can be more powerful and influential than other roles
