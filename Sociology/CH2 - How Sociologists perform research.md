## Methods:
- **scientific method**: a procedure involving the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses based on systematic observation, measurement and/or experiments
- **theory**: an abstracted, systematic model of how some aspect of the world works.
- **research methods:** approaches that social scientists use for investigating the answers to questions.
- methods can be quantitative or qualitative
	- **Quantitative:** methods that seek to obtain information in numeric form
	- **Qualitative:** methods that attempt to collect information that cannot really be expressed in numeric form.
	- both provide ways to establish a causal relationship
- **Causal relationship:** the idea that one factor influences another through a chain of events. this is different from 2 factors being associated or correlated.
## Research:
- **Deductive approach:**
	- starts w/ a theory
	- develops a hypothesis
	- makes empirical observations
	- analyzes the data collected
- **Inductive approach:**
	- starts w/ empirical observations
	- works to form theory
	- determines if a correlation exists by analyzing data
- **Correlation/Association:** when 2 variables tend to track each other positively or negatively
	- natural experiments can be used to explore these
- **Natural experiment:** something that takes place in the world that affects people in a way that is unrelated to any other preexisting factors or their characteristics, thereby approximating random assignment to treatment or control groups.
- **Causality:** when a change in a factor results in a corresponding change in another
	- 3 factors are required: correlation, time order, and ruling out alternative explanations
- **Reverse Causality:** a situation in which the researcher believes that a -> b but, in fact,   a -> b
	- this is why it's important to establish time order.
### Variables:
- **Dependent Variable:** the outcome the researcher is trying to explain
- **Independent variable:** measured factor researcher believes to be a factor 
- it's possible to have more than 1 independent variable.
