## The Sociology of Sociology
### Auguste Comte:
- believed that the best way to understand society is by determining the logic of scientific laws governing human behavior which eh called social physics
- **positivism**: initially called "social physics," this approach to sociology emphasizes the scientific method to study the objectively observable behavior of individuals irrespective of the meanings those action shave for the subjects themselves.
### Harriet Martineau (F):
- First person to translate Comte's written works into English and one of the earliest feminist social scientists.
- Addressed topics ranging from the education of children to the relationship between the federal and state governments.
### Karl Marx:
- proposed the theory of historical materialism, which identifies class conflict as the primary cause of social change
- from his surname the term Marxism (an ideological alternative to capitalism) derives, and his writings provided the theoretical basis of communism
### Max Weber:
- emphasized subjectivity
- to truly understand why people act the way they do, a sociologist must understand the meanings they attach to their actions
- **Verstehen:** German for "understanding"
- **Interpretive sociology:** A type of scholarship in which researchers imagine themselves experiencing the life positions of the social actors they want to understand rather than treating those people as objects to be examined.
### Emile Durkheim:
- wished to understand how society holds together and how modern capitalism and industrialization have transformed the ways people relate to one another
- he proposed that division of labor didn't just affect work and productivity, it also helped determine a society's form of social solidarity
- he's famous for his study if which he argues that *anomie* is a main social force leading to suicide, and he is considered to be a founder of positivist sociology.
- ***Anomie***: a sense of aimlessness or dispair that arises when we can no longer reasonable expect life to be predictable, inadequate
### George Simmel:
- proposed a formal sociology, or a sociology of pure numbers
- his work was influential in the development of urban sociology and cultural sociology, and his work with small-group interactions served as an intellectual precedent for later sociologists who came to study microinteractions.
## American Sociology:
- early american sociology became prominent at the university of chicago
- the "Chicago School" perspective focused on empirical research built on a central belief that people's behaviors and personalities are shaped by their social and physical environments.

### Jane Addams
- Addams founded hull house, where the ideas of the Chicago school were put into practice and tested.
- Addams was a prolific author on both the substance and methodology of community studies and her work at hull house was influential in the development of Chicago school's theories, yet she was never afforded the same respect as the majority of her male contemporaries.
## Functionalism
- the theory that various social institutions and processes in society exist to serve some important function to keep society running
- Talcott Parsons was a leading theorist of functionalism in the mid-20th century
## Conflict Theory
- the idea that conflict between competing interests is the basic animating force of social change and society in general
- according to conflict theorists, inequality exists as a result of political struggles among different groups in a particular society
- although functionalists theorize that inequality is necessary and beneficial aspect of society, conflict theorists argue that it is unfair and exist at the expense of less powerful groups
## Symbolic Interactionism:
- a micro-level theory in which shared meanings, orientations, and assumptions form the basic motivations behind people's actions.
- the groundwork for symbolic interactionism was laid by Erving Goffman's dramaturgical theory of social interaction, which used the language of theater to describe the social facade we create
- according to Goffman, we make judgments about class and social status based on details of how people present themselves to theirs.
