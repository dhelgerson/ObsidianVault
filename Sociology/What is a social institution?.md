## The Sociology of Sociology
### Auguste Comte:
- believed that the best way to understand society is by determining the logic of scientific laws governing human behavior which eh called social physics
- **positivism**: initially called "social physics," this approach to sociology emphasizes the scientific method to study the objectively observable behavior of individuals irrespective of the meanings those action shave for the subjects themselves.
### Harriet Martineau (F):
- First person to translate Comte's written works into English and one of the earliest feminist social scientists.
- Addressed topics ranging from the education of children to the relationship between the federal and state governments.
### Karl Marx:
- proposed the theory of historical materialism, which identifies class conflict as the primary cause of social change
- from his surname the term Marxism (an ideological alternative to capitalism) derives, and his writings provided the theoretical basis of communism
### Max Weber:
- emphasized subjectivity
- to truly understand why people act the way they do, a sociologist must understand the meanings they attach to their actions
- **Verstehen:** German for "understanding"
- **Interpretive sociology:** A type of scholarship in which researchers imagine themselves experiencing the life positions of the social actors they want to understand rather than treating those people as objects to be examined.
### Emile Durkheim:
- wished to understand how society holds together and how modern capitalism and industrialization have transformed the ways people relate to one another
- he proposed that division of labor didn't just affect work and productivity, it also helped determine a society's form of social solidarity
- he's famous for his study if which he argues that *anomie* is a main social force leading to suicide, and he is considered to be a founder of positivist sociology.
- ***Anomie***: a sense of aimlessness or dispair that arises when we can no longer reasonable expect life to be predictable, inadequate
### George Simmel:
- proposed a formal sociology, or a sociology of pure numbers
- his work was influential in the development of urban sociology and cultural sociology, and his work with small-group interactions served as an intellectual precedent for later sociologists who came to study microinteractions.
## American Sociology:
- early american sociology became prominent at the university of chicago
- the "Chicago School" perspective focused on empirical research built on a central belief that people's behaviors and personalities are shaped by their social and physical environments.
