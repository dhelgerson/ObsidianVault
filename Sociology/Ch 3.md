# Mass Media & Social Norms
## Definitions of Culture:
- culture: the sum of the social categories and concepts we embrace as well as beliefs, behaviors, and practices
- the term has also been used to refer to the distinction between what is natural and what is modified
- culture is always a relative concept; we cannot talk about culture without reference to the global world.
- $Culture=Superior-Inferior$
- as colonialism led to interaction w/ non-western peoples, Europeans realized that alternative ways of living existed and questioned the culture they'd previously taken for granted.
- **Ethnocentrism:** the belief that one's own culture or group is superior to others and the tendency to view all other cultures from the perspective of one's own
- $Culture=Man-Machine$
- in $19^{th}$ century, Matthew Arnold redefined culture as the pursuit of perfection and broad knowledge of the world in contrast to narrow self-centeredness
- this was an extension of Plato's argument that culture is an ideal, standing in opposition to the real world.
- Arnold's definition elevated culture above dull, middle-class institutions.
### Material vs Non-material Culture
- **Non-material culture:** values, beliefs, behaviors, and social norms
- **Material culture:** everything that is part of our constructed, physical environment, including technology
- Non-material culture and material culture have bidirectional relationship; they both affect each other
- **Cultural lag:** the time gab between the appearance of a new technology and the words and practices that give it meaning.
### Culture Shock & Code Switching
- culture is what feels normal to us but is actually socially produced
- **Culture Shock:** doubt, confusion, or anxiety arising from immersion in an unfamiliar culture
- **Code Switch:** to flip fluidly between 2 or more languages and sets of cultural norms
- Elijah Anderson notes that many African Americans learn to code switch between standard English and African-American English.
### Language, Meaning, and Concepts
- language is an important part of culture
- according to the sapir-whorf hypothesis in linguistics, the language we speak directly influences the way we thing about and experience the world
- concepts such as race, gender, class, and inequality are part of our culture as well
### Studying Culture
- **Cultureal relativism:** taking into account th edifferences across cultures w/out passing judgements
- interpreting cultural relativism can be difficult when local traditions conflict w/ universally recognized human rights
- **Cultural scripts:** modes of behavior and understanding that are not universal or natural
- margaret mead intoduced the idea that cultural scripts shape our notiong of gender.
## Media:
any formats, platforms, or vehicles that carry, present, or communicate information
- discussions about media are generally about mass media
	- the invention of the printing press and movable type int he 15th
	- the creation of moving pictures at the turn of the 20th century
	- the adoption of the scrolling ticker by today's 24hr news
- Hegemony: a condition where a dominant group uses its power to elicit the voluntary "consent" from the masses
- hegemony stands in contrast to domination, or getting people to do what you want through the use of force
- the concept of hegemony is important for understanding the impact of the media. 
### Media studies:
open paths of investigation, including:
- how people create media
- how the media shape the culture we live
- how the media reflect the culture they exist
- how individuals and groups use the media as their own means to change culture.
#### Racism in media
- the media can create, reinforce, and perpetuate racist ideologies and stereotypes
- these acts of racism and stereotyping can be intentional or unintentional
- in Katrina, black survivors were depicted differently doing the same thing (looting vs finding)
#### Sexism in media
- two frequent critiques of the media centers of the representation of women
	- glamorizing and perpetuating unrealistic ideals of feminine beauty
	- publish images of violence against women
- some advertisers are responding to these criticisms with new approaches

## Sex, sexuality, and gender
- **Sex** refers to the perceived biological differences that society typically uses to distinguish males from females (NOT THE FRICK IT'S NOT)
- **Gender** denotes a social position - namely, the set of social arrangements built around normative sex categories (SURE, MAYBE, BUT THERE'S STILL ONLY 2).
- **Sexuality** refers to desire, sexual preference, sexual identity, and behavior. (sure, i'll give you that, but not the last 2)
### Sex: a process in the making
- the study of gender boils down to seeing how nature and nurture overlap and shape each other
- **Essentialist** arguments explain social phenomena n terms of natural, biological, or evolutionary inevitabilities
- in contrast, sociologists think of the nature-behavior relationship as a 2-way street.
### Theories of gender inequality
- **Feminism** is a social movement to get people to understand that gender is an organizing principle in society and to address gender-based inequalities.
- **2nd wave feminism**: at the start of the 2nd wave of the feminist movement in the 60's, theorists scrambled to find an answer to the 'woman question':
	- what explains the nearly universal dominance of men
	- what is the root of patriarchy?
### parson's sex role theory
- according to **sex role theory**, men and women perform their sex roles as breadwinners and wives/mothers because the nuclear family is the ideal arrangement in modern societies for fulfilling the function of reproducing workers.
- this **structural functionalist** approach to gender:
	- assumes gender differences exist to fulfill necessary societal functions
	- does not allow for the possibility that other structures could fulfill the same function or that structures change throughout history
### Rubin's sex/gender system
- challenged assumption that because women's subordination occurred everywhere, it must be fulfilling some societal function
	- Rubin argues that women are treated like valuable property whose trade patterns strengthen relations between families headed by men
	- this sex/gender system is
### Conflict theories
- conflict theories focus on power and argue that patriarchal capitalists benefit through systems that subordinate women
- socialist feminists, also known as radical feminists, argue that the root of all social relations, including relations of production, stemmed from unequal gender relations.
### Intersectionality (the biggest load of BS in practice)
- black feminism points out the importance of intersectionality, the idea that it is critical to understand the interplay between social identities such as race, class, gender, ability status, and sexual orientation, even though many social systems and institutions try to treat each category on its own
- intersectionality establishes that 'woman' is not a stable or obvious category of identity (oh yes it is)
