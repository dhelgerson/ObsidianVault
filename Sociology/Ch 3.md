# Mass Media & Social Norms
## Definitions of Culture:
- culture: the sum of the social categories and concepts we embrace as well as beliefs, behaviors, and practices
- the term has also been used to refer to the distinction between what is natural and what is modified
- culture is always a relative concept; we cannot talk about culture without reference to the global world.
- $Culture=Superior-Inferior$
- as colonialism led to interaction w/ non-western peoples, Europeans realized that alternative ways of living existed and questioned the culture they'd previously taken for granted.
- **Ethnocentrism:** the belief that one's own culture or group is superior to others and the tendency to view all other cultures from the perspective of one's own
- $Culture=Man-Machine$
- in $19^{th}$ century, Matthew Arnold redefined culture as the pursuit of perfection and broad knowledge of the world in contrast to narrow self-centeredness
- this was an extension of Plato's argument that culture is an ideal, standing in opposition to the real world.
- Arnold's definition elevated culture above dull, middle-class institutions.
### Material vs Non-material Culture
- **Non-material culture:** values, beliefs, behaviors, and social norms
- **Material culture:** everything that is part of our constructed, physical environment, including technology
- Non-material culture and material culture have bidirectional relationship; they both affect each other
- **Cultural lag:** the time gab between the appearance of a new technology and the words and practices that give it meaning.
### Culture Shock & Code Switching
- culture is what feels normal to us but is actually socially produced
- **Culture Shock:** doubt, confusion, or anxiety arising from immersion in an unfamiliar culture
- **Code Switch:** to flip fluidly between 2 or more languages and sets of cultural norms
- Elijah Anderson notes that many African Americans learn to code switch between standard English and African-American English.
### Language, Meaning, and Concepts
- language is an important part of culture
- according to the sapir-whorf hypothesis in linguistics, the language we speak directly influences the way we thing about and experience the world
- concepts such as race, gender, class, and inequality are part of our culture as well
