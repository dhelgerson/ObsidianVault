# Capitalism 
is an economic system in which
- property and goods are primarily privately owned
- investments are determined by private decisions
- the prices, production, and distribution of goods are determined primarily by competition in tan unfettered marketplace
- started to develop between 15$^{th}$ and 19$^{th}$ century
### Feudalism
precapitalist economic system characterized by the presence of lords, vassals, serfs, and fiefs
- began to change as early as the 15$^{th}$ century with the enclosure movement, which forced people off formerly public land and sent them to look for work in cities
### Agricultural Revolution
- in the 18th century, new farming tech led to increased food output
	- this helped increase the population & value of land
	- led to innovations in manufacturing and transport due to a growing labor pool
### Industrialization & its changes:
- barter -> use of legal currency
- personal agreements -> Legal contracts
**Corporation:** a legal entity unto itself that has a legal person-hood distinct from that of its members - namely, its owners and shareholders
## Theories of Capitalism
- Adam Smith was an economist who believed that
	- competition helps maintain a cohesive society
	- specialization increases productivity and innovation
	- using money rather than barter, makes trading more efficient
- George Simmel
	- believed that changing from piecework payment to wave labor and then to salary would depersonalize exchange
	- proposed that as a good way to separate public and private spheres and give workers more freedom to enjoy the private life
- Karl Marx (needn't I remind u)
- Max Weber
	- linked the rise of capitalism to technology, idea, and beliefs as well as the protestant reformation
	- became concerned that capitalism caused people to become so obsessed with working and making money to the point that they lacked the free time to enjoy the fruits of their labor
### Changing Wages
- today, people actually earn less money (relative to cost of living) than in the early 1900's because then:
	- only men were supposed to work
	- men were paid a family wage - enough to provide for a whole family
	- unfortunately the higher wage came at the cost of women's freedom & autonomy - **BS**
### Benefits
- compared to other industrialized countries and some developing countries, americans work longer hours and have fewer vacation benefits and less generous femily leave policies
- even when generous benefits are available, workers often fail to take advantage of them
### Service Sector
the section of economy that provides intangible services
- has grown rapidly over the last 30 yrs
- much work in the service sector involves **emotional labor** - managing emotions and their outward expression to meet the expectations of a job
## Globalization
the processes that create and intensify worldiwde social exchanges and interdependencies
- creates an increase in trade and economic exchanges
- magnifies the division between the world's rich and poor
