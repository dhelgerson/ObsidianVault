### Feudalism

- began to change as early as the 15$^{th}$ century with the enclosure movement, which forced people off formerly public land and sent them to look for work in cities
### Agricultural Revolution

- personal agreements -> Legal contracts
**Corporation:** a legal entity unto itself that has a legal person-hood distinct from that of its members - namely, its owners and shareholders
## Theories of Capitalism

	- competition helps maintain a cohesive society
	- specialization increases productivity and innovation
	- using money rather than barter, makes trading more efficient
- George Simmel
	- believed that changing from piecework payment to wave labor and then to salary would depersonalize exchange
	- proposed that as a good way to separate public and private spheres and give workers more freedom to enjoy the private life
- Karl Marx (needn't I remind u)
- Max Weber
	- linked the rise of capitalism to technology, idea, and beliefs as well as the protestant reformation
