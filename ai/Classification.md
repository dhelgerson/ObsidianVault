# Inductive Bias
- most people, about 2/3, think class A(see slides) is birds and class B is mammals
- Others, about 1/3, think Class A is animals that fly and class B is animals that don't
- The test examples are classified differently depending on how the training data is generalized
- the difference in whether we generalize the training data one way or the other is not based on anything in the data! it reflects our "inductive bias"
Inductive bias is necessary because learning in an ill-posed problem; the training data is not sufficient to find a unique solution
