## A* algorithm
- enhanced version of Dijkstra's algorithm
- heuristic search (uses a bit of extra information to search more intelligently)

- g(n): path cost from start to n
- h(n): lower bound on optimal path cost from node n to goal node
- h*(n): optimal path cost fro node n to goal node
- f(n): lower bound on optimal cost of path from start node s to goal node that goes through node n
