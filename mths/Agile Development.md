## what is is?
- popularized in 2001
- derived from others, most notably scrum, kanban
	- agile scruc, kanban are still used alot together
- can be somewhat controversial
	- arguments on whether it's effective in dev as studies on the method tend to lack evidence one way or the other
## scrum and kanban
- scrum
	- designed for teams of 10 or fewer
	- most popular takeaway is "scrum meetings"
		- daily meetings between all members for at least 15min to touch bases
- kanban
	- inspired by toyota
	- aims to streamline workflow to alleviate bottlenecks
		- usually does so through visualization of tasks
## agile
- focuses a lot on adaptiveness and collaboration between team members
- agile is an umbrella term for software dev that follows the 4 values in the manifesto for agile software dev and the 12 principles behind it
### 4 values
- **individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **responding to change** over following a plan
### 12 principles (paraphrased)
- you should always be developing the software
- you should always be getting feedback and incorporating it into your change.
	- this goes with the expectation that you always have a somewhat functioning code-base, even during dev,
- **DELIVER THE DANG SOFTWARE**
- ideally you should say "yes" to any demand your customers have. this makes your company more competitive "allegedly"
## Implementing agile
- iterative and incremental progress
	- typically there's a "sprint" of a project. this lasts 1-4 weeks and encompasses every stage of dev.
- efficient, face-to-face communication
	- team members collaborate
		- many places say that devs should be in the same room
	- when dealing w/ customers, there tends to be an elected liason
- short feedback loop
	- the daily meeting are now called stand-ups
- quality control
	- tools such as continuous integration testing, unit testing, pair programming, and more are typically used often to improve quality and streamline dev
## downsides to agile
- difficult to implement
	- training and coordination is key
- entry-level programmers usually aren't a good fit
- agile can be hard to adapt in larger companies
- dev burnout is a real thing
- production design suffers due to lack of documentation
- confusion
## critisisms
- it's young and controversial
- many large coorps claim it's too inefficient to adopt
