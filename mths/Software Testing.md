- series of tests you put your software through with the goal that the product is finished and working
- typical verification
	- meets requirements laid out by customer
	- responds correctly to a series of inputs
	- performs the correct function within reasonable time-frame
	- actually usable from a user perspective
	- runs in production environment
- testing approaches:
	- static
	- dynamic
	- passive
	- exploratory
- the "box" approach
	- white-box and black-box testing
- 3 main levels of testing:
	- unit
	- integration
	- system
## Box testing
- white-box
	- you have the knowledge of your code-base
	- use this knowledge to create tests that could make it fail
- black-box
	- no knowledge of internal code
	- no coding experience is needed for this
## Unit Testing
- testing the individual segments of code
	- no interaction with other modules
- unit tests are fine-grained
	- input testing
	- output testing
	- crashes?
	- are the outputs correct
- uses white-box theories
- often automated using testing packages*
## Integration Testing
- done after unit tests
- focuses on dependencies between modules
- broader level of test than unit tests
	- i.e. when someone opens a menu, is the right query called
- still somewhat fine-tuned
- can be done by devs of independent testers
- can be black-box or white-box
## System testing
- done after integration testing
- aka functional testing
- tests workflows to see if everything is functioning as intended
	- inputs correctly handled
	- error messages prop
