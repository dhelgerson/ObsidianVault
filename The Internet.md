## Nuts and bolts:
* billions of connected devices
	- hosts=end systems
* packet switches
* comm links
* networks (i.e. network of networks)
#Q what are some examples of devices connected  to internet: pc, phone tablet, etc.
## Protocols:
control sending, receiving of messages
- HTTP, TCP, IP, WiFi, GSM, CDMA, 
#Q what is a protocol: a set of rules for an interaction
- protocols define the format, order, of messages sent/received among entities, and actions taken on trans/recv
## Standards
ensure interoperability
- RFC: request for comments
- IETF: Internet engineering task force
## Services
- Web, streaming, multimedia, conferencing, email, etc.
## Programming interface
- hooks allow comms 
- provides service options
## Structure
Edge:
- hosts: clients and servers
- servers in datacenters
Access Network:
- wired, wireless comms link
Network Core:
- interconnected routers
- network of networks
## Access Networks and phy. media
#Q How to connect end systems to edge router: residential nets
Fibre to the node vs fibre to the home:
- difference between running fibre to a node per neighborhood, multiple houses getting fibre, vs running fibre straight to each home.
Routing vs switching: perspective
- routing is looking at it all at once
- switching is what's going on at a specific place
#Q packet vs circuit switching
